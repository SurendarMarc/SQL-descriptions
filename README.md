# SQL-descriptions
SQL was invented in the 1970s by IBM and was first commercially distributed by Oracle. The original name was SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), later shortened to SQL. It is a standardized programming language used to manage, manipulate and interact with relational databases.

It allow users to perform tasks such as querying data, creating and modifying database structures, and managing access permissions. SQL is widely used across various relational database management systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.SQL allows you to efficiently query, update, and manage relational databases.
Data Retrieval: SQL constructs a query that tells the Database Management System (DBMS) what data is required.
DBMS Processes Query: The DBMS processes the SQL query, retrieves the data and returns it to the user or application.
Declarative Nature: SQL is declarative, meaning it focuses on what data should be retrieved, organized or modified, leaving the how to the DBMS.
SQL encompasses DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands, which handle operations like creating, updating, and modifying database structures and data.
